            <p>
                The Great Gatsby is a timeless exploration of the American Dream and the pursuit of happiness. Fitzgerald's poetic prose and complex characters draw readers into a world of luxury, longing, and loss. Gatsby's tragic flaws and the ultimate futility of his dreams offer a poignant critique of the idea that wealth and status can bring fulfillment. The novel's exploration of themes like love, aspiration, and disillusionment makes it a compelling and thought-provoking read.
